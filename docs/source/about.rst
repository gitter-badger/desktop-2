About SiDE
==========

Our Goal
--------

Keep the traditional desktop layout, while we still want to provide a shell which is based on
many modern toolkits like for example GTK3.

Beside the technology aspects, the thing which is most important is that our software
is **free** in two ways: Free as in freedom **AND** free as in free beer :)
