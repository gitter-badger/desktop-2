# Idea

The Idea for SiDE came with the JetSpace project. I wanted to create a
usefull UI for the distro.
Okay, right now it is quite far away from that...

But we keep on working!

# Versions

Versions follow the following idea: `MAYOR`.`MINOR`(-`rc or alpha`)

Alpha Versions for 1.00 are planned with `0.50`, `0.70` and `0.80`. After
that, we continue with Beta versions, which should not get any new functions,
they should only improve stability! Beta Version will be `0.85` and `0.90` and `0.95 - 0.99`.
Finally we will deploy release candidates (`rc`). There will be as many rc versions as
needed to create a fully stable Desktop Enviroment.

First Beta versions are planned until Christmas 2015.
Final 1.00 should be out until summer 2016.
