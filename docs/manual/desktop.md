### Layout

The Wallpaper service is currently quite simple. It displays the Wallpaper ;)
and provides a basic context menu:

* Run (run dialog, see [Panel](panel.md))
* Change Wallpaper (opens the wallpaper settings)
* Log Out (end session, see [Panel](panel.md))

### Options

![Wallpaper Settings](../img/side-wallpaper-settings.png)

Here you can simply change the Wallpaper (like the [S paceX Dragon](http://spacex.com/dragon)). Use
Open to load a file browser, where you can select an image to use as background.

__Note:__ The Image is scaled, so it should fit more or less the resolution of your screen,
otherwise you will get bad results.

Use clear to remove the current Wallpaper and use an empty window as background.
