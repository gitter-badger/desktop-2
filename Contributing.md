You are always welcome to help developing the SIDE desktop.

Please note that when you add a little function, you may could just create a seperate plugin...
But anyways, when you want to help you can!

Fork the Repo and create a new branch which discripes the function, for example if you want to implement a Workspace
Switcher for the Panel, name it 'workspace-switcher'.

Then comes the fun part: Code ;-)

After that create a pull request (PR) and please don't forget to put your name in the AUTHORS array (shared/info.h)!
