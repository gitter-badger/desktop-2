#JetSpace Desktop

This is a (very) simple Desktop enviroment

it is not useable yet... (of course you can try it :D )

##to test:

1. go to all subdirs and run 'make'

2. go to the main dir and run 'sudo make install'

3. launch 'startx', but first create a .xinitrc in your home folder with the content: 'xterm'

4. In the terminal type 'openbox &' or any other WM

5. go to the desktop dir and run make

6. Youre Done!
